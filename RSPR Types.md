Randomly Selected Parts Race
========
A Randomly Selected (Custom) Parts Race (RSPR) is a type of sub-game for F-Zero GX. The idea comes from "Sealed Pack Play" chalenge, a card game tournament where you're given a set number of new booster packs from which to build a deck and compete with. Likewise for F-Zero GX, we randomly select parts and compete with the machines they can create.

## Rules of Play

There are multiple settings for each race, as well as contestant factors which may dictate how the races are played out. In general, simply find the rules you wish to use with your friends.

### Ratios
Ratios are the number of parts compared to other parts generated for each match. The ratio is always Body:Cockpit:Booster. A 1:1:1 ratio means 1 Body part, 1 Cockpit part, and 1 Booster part.

Body is the most influential part while the Cockpit is the least influencial. Because of this, it is advised to increment the ratios in order of Body, Booster, and lastly Cockpit.

    1:1:1, 2:1:1, 2:1:2,
    2:2:2, 3:2:2, 3:2:3,
    3:3:3, 4:3:3, 4:3:4... and so on.

### Regular Parts
Regular Parts requires that the contestants have all 60 Standard Body, Cockpit, and Booster parts (20 per category.) No Special Parts may be used (AX parts, JP parts.)

### All Parts
Regular Parts requires that the contestants have all 75 Body, Cockpit, and Booster parts (25 per category.) The parts may be aquired legally or with the use of a Cheat Device, notably Action Replay or with Gecko Code on a modified Wii console.

### Cup Sets
The standard cup hierarchy is _**Ruby > Sapphire > Emerald > Diamond > AX**_. However, any order is permitted. 

**Single Cup**: A run of a 1 cup.  
**Dual Cup**: A run of 2 cups, usually in hierarchy.  
**Tri-Cup**: A run of 3 cups, usually in hierarchy.  
**Quad-Cups**: A run of 4 cups, often Ruby through Diamond.  
**All-Cups**: A run of every cup, usually in hierarchy.  

## Game Types

### Unique Machine(s)
Each individual player has their own Uniquely generated set of custom parts. Each competitor will therefore have varying machines to choose from.

### Same Machine(s)
Each player uses the same set of custom parts. Each competitor will therefore have the same machine, or machines dirived from the same set of generated parts.

## Tournament
### Single-Elimination Tournament
Single-Elimination Tournaments will require minimum 4 participants, with no maximum. Once a participant loses, they are out of the tournament.

### Double-Elimination Tournament
Double-Elimination Tournaments will require minimum 4 participants, with no maximum. Winners of a bracket move up, while losers are put into the Losers Bracket.

### Rounds
#### Cup Matches
Each round consists of a single cup, wherein the player whom completes it the fastest is the winner.

#### Track Matches
Each round consists of one or multiple tracks, wherein the player whom completes them the fastest is the winner. Multiple track rounds are a best-of set. The winner is determined by the Results Screen time.

------

#### Forfeit Matches
The winner of a bracket picks any of the losing opponent's parts to add to his set of custom parts for possible use in later matches. This play style suits Double-Elimination Tournaments*.

⋆ A base set is 1:1:1, any additional parts are the spare parts.

    i.e.: 2:1:2 has 2 spare parts.

⋆ The number of spare parts should match that of the amount of rounds minus 1. This is due to that, once a player loses a part, their ratio decreases, and it cannot decrease to lower than 1:1:1. As such, there must be enough forfeitable parts for one to be lost each match without resulting in the lack of parts to participate.

    Ratio for tournament should be: SpareParts = nRounds -1.

#### Swap Matches
The winner of a bracket *must* pick any of the losing opponent's parts to add to his set of custom parts, regardless if they are undiserable. This works best with 1:1:1 sets.
