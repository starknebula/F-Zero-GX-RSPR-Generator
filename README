What is an RSPR?
* An RSPR is a Randomly Selected (Custom) Parts Race - a challenge similar to "Sealed Pack Play," a card game tournament where you're given a set number of new booster packs from which to build a deck and compete with. For F-Zero GX, we randomly select parts and compete with the machines they can create.

1) Download the RSPR Generator HTML file.
2) Open it with any web-browser you wish.
3) Generate Parts! Simply click on one of the ratios*!
  * Ratios are Body:Cockpit:Booster

Happy randomizing!
