# RSPR Tournmament 1

## Questions & Concerns

### What is an RSPR?
A Randomly Selected (Custom) Parts Race (RSPR) is a type of sub-game for F-Zero GX. The idea comes from the "Sealed Pack Play" chalenge, a card game tournament where you're given a set number of new booster packs from which to build a deck and compete with. Likewise for F-Zero GX, we randomly select parts and compete with the machines they can create.

### What is this?
It's a *For Fun* F-Zero GX tournament. The idea is to try and reinvent the way we play GX on SRL. Since the machines are random, you must learn to pick up a unque custom machine and try to find how to use it best.

### How do I join?
Either drop in the F-Zero Central IRC ( [irc2.speedrunslive.com #f-zero](http://irc.lc/irc2.speedrunslive.com/f-zero/YourNickname "Mibbit Online IRC") ) using your favoured IRC Client or tweet me [@StarkNebula](https://twitter.com/StarkNebula "twitter.com/StarkNebula") on Twitter. You will also need a registered Nick on the speedrunslive server. For more information, go to [SRL's FAQ section](http://speedrunslive.com/faq/registration/  "RSPR Types"). You will need to proved your SRL nickname and [your time zone in GMT format](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ "greenwichmeantime.com").

### Do I need to stream to participate?
Yes. Though you do not need an extraordinary connection. A 320x240 resolution is just fine. We simply need to verify that you are indeed using your designated custom machine. You do not need a mic, nor even audio.

### I don't know if I can find the time for this...
Don't worry, the scheduling will take place over the course of about 2 weeks, with matches taking place at the participants' convienience.

### **Specifically**, when is the tournament?
There's is no set date yet. We will figure out the scheduling once we have enough participants.

### What Custom Parts do I need?
For this tournament, you will need all 60 Standard Parts. You are permitted to use a Cheat Device or Program to unlock the parts. Obviously, you are not permitted to have any cheat active during the tournament.
