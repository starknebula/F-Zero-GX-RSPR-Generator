# RSPR Tournament 1

### What is an RSPR?
A Randomly Selected (Custom) Parts Race (RSPR): a type of sub-game for F-Zero GX. The idea comes from the "Sealed Pack Play" chalenge, a card game tournament where you're given a set number of new booster packs from which to build a deck and compete with. Likewise, we randomly select parts for each participant. The players must use their knowledge and preference of the parts to build a machine to compete with.

This is a _**For Fun**_ F-Zero GX tournament. It's a fresh take on a game that has since become only about optimization. Contrary to that philosophy, it is spontaneous and unpredictable for the purpose of _**fun**_. Since each player is assigned random parts, one must learn to pick up a new, unique custom machine and try to find how to use it best.

### How do I join?
Drop in the F-Zero Central IRC ([irc2.speedrunslive.com #f-zero](http://irc.lc/irc2.speedrunslive.com/f-zero/YourNickname "Mibbit Online IRC")) using your favoured IRC Client  and ask either StarkNebula or Yazzo to join. Alternativley, you may tweet me [@StarkNebula](https://twitter.com/StarkNebula "twitter.com/StarkNebula") on Twitter. You will need to proved your SRL nickname* and [your time zone in GMT format](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ "greenwichmeantime.com").

> *You will need a registered Nick on the speedrunslive server. For more information, go to [SRL's FAQ section](http://speedrunslive.com/faq/registration/ "RSPR Types").

We will then reserve spot in the tournament seeding, or backlog you into the reserved seating should someone drop out. Once the seeding is complete, brackets will be assigned. We will contact you to confirm your seed. You must reply within 72 hours to reserve that seed. If not, you will forfeit your spot to the next reserve participant.

##### I don't know if I can find the time for this...
Don't worry, the tournament will take place over the course of about 2 weeks, with matches taking place at the participants' convienience. We will try our best, but we cannot guarantee you perfect hours.

### **Specifically**, when is the tournament?
There's is no set date yet. We will figure out the scheduling once we have enough participants. (16 participants.)

### Do I need to stream to participate?
Yes. Though you do not need an extraordinary connection. A 320x240 resolution is just fine. We simply need to verify that you are indeed using your designated custom machine. You do not need a mic, nor even audio. Your stream will likely be restreamed via the [F-Zero Central twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/team/fzc "twitch.tv/team/fzc"). *_Ironing out details._

### How are parts assigned?
I will generated the parts for each participant using this [script](http://starknebula.github.io/F-Zero-GX-RSPR-Generator/ "F-Zero GX RSPR Generator 0.3.1").
